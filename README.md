Paradismeds: The one stop solution to all your medical concerns and worries!

Introduction:

Paradismeds is a small scale working prototype of a hospital management system where the user will be able to gain access to multiple features all within one single website:
1.) A map system where the following will be displayed:Booking B
  i.) Distnace of the hospital from the current location of the user
  ii.) Rating of that hospital
  iii.) The type and speciality of the hospital
  
2.)Taking appoinments
Patients can choose the suitable doctor tailored according to their ailment and can seek the required guidance under the smae expert ,edical staff by booking an appointment.

3.)Booking beds
Patients who need to be admitted to a hospital can check the availability of beds prior to admission, saving a lot of precious time and effort in browsing through each individual hospital's webpage on the internet 

Tech-stack used:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JakartaServerPages (formely known as JavaServerPages).

Back-end: Django

API: Bingmaps API with JavaScript

4.)Technical challenges that we faced:
1.) Since the frontend developers of the team were working in VS code editor and the backend ones in Pycharm, there were a few times when the Django syntax clashed with that of HTML and CSS, leading to interesting merge conflicts when commited on github.
2.) Finding the right API was a tough task as well. With GoogleMaps API becoming paid, we had to resort to extensib=vely searching the web for alternatives where we stumbled upon Bingmaps API, thereby ending up using it in our project
3.) With only the rudimentary skills of a web-developer, we were limited to the use of quite basic development tools and languages such as HTML,CSS,JS,JSP and Django, which forced us to think out of the box multiple times as we brainstormed creative ideas to bypass the problems we encountered.
